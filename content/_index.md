# Pieter Engelbrecht
## Aka. chesedo
### Rust Programming Language Consultant / Freelancer
With 3+ years of exclusive Rust experience, including an undergrad thesis on procedural macros, I offer
specialized services for:
- Architecting Rust projects
- Senior role for teams adopting Rust
- One-off Rust projects
- Maintaining Rust code

As a Software Craftsmanship advocate, I emphasize:
- Test Driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration (CI)
- Effective use of design patterns, which includes knowing when not to use them

I am also available to teach these crafting skills, Rust, or creating procedural macros to anyone
interested.
